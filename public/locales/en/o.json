  "letter": "<p>The lips are rounded and a bit put forward. They are far from teethmaking the rounded opening of the mouth. This position is very importantfor the acoustic impression. The lips have a bit smaller opening thenwith sounds A and E. The distance between lips is about 35 mm. Thetightness is made around the oral muscle, so the cheeks becomedeepen.</p><p>The distance between teeth is about 15-35 mm.</p><p>Tongue has the same position as with sound A, a bit lowered anddeepen in the front part, moved backward, so it is far from the upperincisors and along whole its length narrow. The root of the tongue islifted in the back part of the cavity, so that way the back of thetongue comes closer to the soft palate.</p><p>Soft palate is lifted and closes the airstream into the nasal cavity,but the tongue does not touch the palate.</p><p>The vocal chords vibrate - the sound is voiced.</p><p>The sound O is vowel of the back line, of the middle intensity, withthe range from 420-2600Hz.</p><p>The first formant is between 420-630Hz.</p><p>The second formant is between 780-900Hz.</p><p>The third formant is between 2380-2600Hz.</p><p>Mistakes in pronunciation of the sound O.</p><p>The sound O has a nasal tone.</p><p>Cause: the soft palate is not lifted enough, so the air comes to thenasal cavity. Show the airstream and the lifting of the soft palate onthe VISAG.</p><p>The sound O is similar to the sound A.</p><p>Cause: irregular position of the lips or the tongue, or the lower jawis lowered too much. The child should be shown the position of speechorgans.</p>"
