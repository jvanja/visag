  "aboutVisag": "<h1> Welcome to the official page of the <strong>VISAG</strong> application <br> <strong>Visual Stimulator of Sounds!</strong> </h1> <p> Hearing and sight are inextricably linked in a child’s speech development. Visual perceptions make up over 80% of all information we receive through the senses. For individuals with hearing impairments, sight becomes a crucial tool in communication. Recognizing this importance, we created <strong>VISAG</strong> — an innovative application that assists deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals in sound articulation. </p> <h2>What is VISAG?</h2> <p> <strong>VISAG</strong> is a program that provides animations of Serbian language sounds, focusing on the movements of speech organs during pronunciation. Some consonants are represented in syllables for easier articulation. Each sound is visually displayed during pronunciation, allowing children with various hearing and speech impairments to learn the correct articulation of each sound. </p> <h2>How does VISAG help?</h2> <ul> <li> <strong>Visual support:</strong> It helps compensate for hearing with vision, allowing children to see how sounds are formed. </li> <li> <strong>Focus on details:</strong> Attention to mimicry, lip movements, and the position of speech organs. </li> <li> <strong>Tailored approach:</strong> Ideal for individual work and adaptation to the needs of each child. </li> </ul> <h2>Recommendations for use:</h2> <p> Before starting with <strong>VISAG</strong>, we recommend: </p> <ul> <li> <strong>Preparation of speech organs:</strong> Performing breathing and motor exercises for speech organs. </li> <li> <strong>Combining with other tools:</strong> Use in combination with hearing aids, SAFU devices, rhythmic stimulations, and other methods to develop auditory perception. </li> </ul> <p>Read more about these exercises on <a href=\"/exercizes\">this page</a>.</p> <p> <strong>Explore VISAG and discover a new world of communication.</strong> Together, we can help children with hearing impairments develop their speech skills and gain confidence in communication.</p>",
  "exercizes": "<h1>Recommended Exercises Before Using VISAG</h1> Before we start using VISAG, it is necessary to prepare the child’s speech apparatus with appropriate breathing exercises and exercises for speech apparatus motor skills. <h2>SPEECH APPARATUS</h2> The organs involved in the formation of sounds/speech/ are called the speech apparatus. The speech apparatus is composed of organs engaged in this process. Based on their function, they are divided into: <ul> <li>RESPIRATORY organs</li> <li>LARYNX</li> <li>CAVITIES above the larynx.</li> </ul> <h2>I RESPIRATORY ORGANS consist of:</h2> <ol> <li>Lungs</li> <li>Bronchi</li> <li>Trachea</li> </ol> <h2>II LARYNX</h2> The larynx is located at the intersection of the respiratory and digestive tracts in the midline at the front of the neck. It is responsible for sound production. <h2>III CAVITIES ABOVE THE LARYNX</h2> consist of three cavities: <ol> <li>Pharyngeal-throat</li> <li>Oral - between the larynx and the mouth</li> <li>Nasal - nose cavity</li> </ol> <h2>SPEECH APPARATUS MOTOR SKILLS EXERCISES</h2> <h3>Lip Exercises</h3> The lips are very mobile during the articulation of numerous sounds. They can be: OPEN, CLOSED, PUFFED, ROUNDED, OVAL, STRETCHED, CURLED, HALF-CLOSED, HALF-OPEN, PROTRUDED, and NEUTRAL. Lip exercises are particularly important in working with these children, especially in articulation processes. <ol> <li>Opening and closing with pauses.</li> <li>Moving lips up, down, left, and right with clenched teeth.</li> <li>Moving lips in all four directions with an open mouth.</li> <li>Pushing out closed lips and rounding them.</li> <li>Wide mouth opening, stretching the lips, and alternately stretching them to the sides.</li> <li>Raising the upper lip toward the nose and lowering it as much as possible.</li> <li>Alternately biting the upper then lower lip, and vice versa.</li> <li>Imitating sucking, sucking in lips, licking - lip to lip, giving a kiss, pushing out and pulling back the lips.</li> </ol> <br>9. Stretching lip corners with and without showing teeth. <h3>Tongue Exercises</h3> Tongue mobility is crucial as it participates in articulating numerous sounds. Tongue mobility should be practiced in various ways. <ol> <li>Sticking out and retracting the tongue.</li> <li>Licking the teeth with the tongue, from the outside and inside.</li> <li>Licking lips with the tip of the tongue (circular) from the inside and outside.</li> <li>Touching the alveoli of upper and lower incisors with the tip of the tongue (mouth open).</li> <li>Moving the tongue tip towards the nose tip and chin base.</li> <li>Pulling the tongue root towards the soft palate.</li> <li>Quickly moving the tongue in-out, up-down, and in circles.</li> <li>Pressing the tongue against upper and lower incisors.</li> <li>Forming a groove in the middle of the tongue.</li> <li>Vibrating the tongue tip \"r r r r r r r r r\".</li> </ol> <h2>Lower Jaw Exercises</h2> Articulation accuracy depends on the lower jaw's position and mobility. <ol> <li>Opening and closing the jaw.</li> <li>Moving the jaw left-right, down-up with an open mouth.</li> <li>Moving the jaw left-right, down-up with a closed mouth.</li> <li>Rotating the lower jaw.</li> </ol> <h2>BREATHING EXERCISES</h2> Breathing is essential for the cellular and systemic functions, as well as a fundamental factor in the functioning of the speech apparatus. The airflow is very important in speech. Proper breathing is crucial for quality articulation. It is essential to conduct breathing exercises systematically, especially in the pre-articulatory and articulatory stages. Often, lung capacity in deaf and hard-of-hearing children is weaker than in children with normal hearing. When conducting these exercises, attention should be given to specific hygiene requirements: <ul> <li>Breathing exercises should be conducted outdoors where there is no dust or smoke or in clean, well-ventilated rooms.</li> <li>Exercises should not last long and should not tire the children.</li> </ul> <p>Pay attention to specific pedagogical requirements:</p> <ul> <li>Exercises should be varied</li> <li>Should be conducted precisely</li> <li>Conduct them at the beginning of the session</li> <li>Breathing exercises should be conducted in sitting, standing, and lying positions</li> <li>Perform exercises without excessive inhalation or exhalation</li> <li>Exercises should be done relaxed</li> <li>Include senses during breathing exercises</li> </ul> <p>Use various didactic tools during these exercises</p> <h3>Breathing Exercises for Preschool Children</h3> <ol> <li>Blowing on paper pieces</li> <li>Inflating balloons</li> <li>Making soap bubbles</li> <li>Blowing on a lit candle from different distances</li> <li>Blowing on toys in water</li> <li>Blowing through a straw into a glass of water to create waves</li> <li>Blowing on a friend’s hair</li> <li>Blowing on a paper windmill</li> <li>Blowing on a flute or harmonica</li> <li>Imitating animal breathing</li> <li>Blowing on glass or a mirror to fog it up</li> <li>Alternately inflating cheeks and hitting them with a fist</li> <li>Blowing on cupped hands like a trumpet</li> <li>Inhaling and exhaling through teeth - exercise for pronouncing dental sounds</li> <li>Imitating a train releasing steam \"f.....sh......\"</li> <li>Bee buzzing \"Z......Z......Z......\"</li> <li>Blowing on hot food</li> <li>Imitating rain \"Sh......Sh......\"</li> <li>Wind sound \"F.........F......\"</li> </ol> <p>NOTE: Be cautious when performing these exercises to avoid any adverse effects (such as triggering epileptic seizures).</p> <h2>SOUND FORMATION</h2> <ol> <li>On VISAG, the position of the articulatory organs for pronouncing each specific sound is visually displayed.</li> <li>Provide a complete description of normal articulation and explain to the child what they should focus on when pronouncing the sound: lip position, mouth opening, mouth angle, tongue position, lower jaw activity, visibility of tongue, vocal cords, nostrils vibration, etc.</li> <li>Assess muscle tension or articulatory tone.</li> <li>Develop the sound in three positions: initial, medial, and final.</li> <li>Practice the sound for automated pronunciation. The animation text provides a detailed description of each sound's articulation role as guidelines and as a reminder for speech therapists to make the most of VISAG.</li> </ol> <h2>Function of the Lungs:</h2> Lung air passes through the oral cavity freely – without any interference - continuously. <h2>Function of the Larynx</h2> One of the main elements in sound formation. The vocal cords are located here. In the pronunciation of voiced sounds, the vocal cords are set in motion and produce sound waves. <h2>Function of the Lower Jaw:</h2> The lower jaw can take a position for breathing through the nose, called the ZERO POSITION. In this position, the dental arches of the upper and lower jaws are not in contact, creating a certain JAW ANGLE characteristic of its position during nasal breathing. If the jaw angle is smaller than the angle of the lower jaw in nasal breathing with a closed mouth, this position would be classified as negative. The jaw angle can be divided into: <ol> <li>HALF-CLOSED</li> <li>HALF-OPEN</li> <li>OPEN</li> <li>NEGATIVE</li> <li>ZERO.</li> </ol>",
