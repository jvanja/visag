Occlusion is partial and inaccordance with the palate and alveoli of the upper incisors. The rootof the tongue and the side edges are pulled down so the openings aremade bilabial and that is the way where the airstream runs during thephonation. The point of articulation occupies the area from the teeth tothe beginning of hard palate. The touchable space is small, because itis limited by the tip of the tongue. The tip of the tongue is not tightbut it is strong enough not to spread widely. The airstream does notproduce friction, but it runs laterally free.</p><p>The soft palate is lifted.</p><p>The vocal chords vibrate - sound L is voiced.</p><p>Concentrates of acoustic energy:</p><ol><li>100-500Hz</li><li>2500-3000Hz</li><li>3500-3700Hz</li></ol>"
