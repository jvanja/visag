The distance between theteeth is less than 1 mm.</p><p>Lower jaw is forward and calm during the pronunciation of thesound.</p><p>The tongue is lifted behind upper incisors by its front part, butdoes not touch them. The edges of the middle of tongue are lifted to theeye-teeth and the first molar teeth. That makes a groove in the middle.The tip of the tongue is lifted and bended backwards behind the upperincisors. Expiratory stream hits the front upper incisors, goes back tothe resonator, which make friction characteristic for this sound.</p><p>Soft palate is lifted so the whole expiration is directed through theoral resonator that is based between the tip of the tongue and the lowerteeth.</p><p>The vocal chords do not vibrate - the sound is unvoiced.</p><p>Expiratory air is rather strong, large and warm.</p><p>Concentrates of acoustic energy are the same as with sound @.</p>"
