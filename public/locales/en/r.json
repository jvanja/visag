The tip of the tongue becomesthin and pulled backwards. The middle part of the tongue becomes concaveand makes tube funnel - like crevice, about 5 mm long. Expiratory streamthat runs over the tongue, hits the lifted tip and moves it forward, butbeing elastic, it comes back into the original position. That is how thevibration of tongue begins. The speed of vibration, which goes from thepalate to the edge of upper incisors and back, and the interruption ofthe airstream as well, make the feeling of friction on the running ofthe air, which is continuous, makes friction, and that makes sound Rfricative sound. The sound is free and vibrate to the upper alveoli.</p><p>The upper edges of the tongue softly touch the palate from the bothsides from the top to the bottom of the upper alveoli and arch of teeth.The middle part of the tongue is wide and pressed against the side teeth- molar teeth. The root of the tongue is a bit lifted and a bit pulledback.</p><p>Soft palate is lifted.</p><p>Vocal chords vibrate and those vibrations are transmitted to thethroat, chin and teeth.
