  "letter": "<p>The lips are closed. They touch each other strongly along the wholelength.</p><p>The whole jaw moves a bit backward, so it becomes larger for 2-3 mmduring the explosion.</p><p>The tongue lies calmly at the bottom of oral cavity and has a naturalposition. The tip of the tongue touches the inner side of the lower jawwith the gums with its whole edge.</p><p>Soft palate is lifted and closes the passage for the airstream to thenasal cavity, so that way the expiration stream is compressed in theoral cavity.</p><p>The vocal chords do not vibrate. The sound is unvoiced.</p><p>According to the acoustics, sound P is invoiced, bilabial plosive asound that is formed by the producing of complete occlusion by closingof the lips and lifting of the soft palate.</p><p>Acoustic structure of plosive P occupies low concentrate of rustleacoustic energy:</p><p>The first concentrate is based between 250-400Hz</p><p>The second concentrate is based between 1800-2200Hz</p><p>The third concentrate is based between 2300-3000Hz.</p><p>The mistakes in pronunciation, which may be shown: instead of soundP, sound F is pronounced.</p><p>Cause: labial closing is weak, the air pressure insufficient,expiratory stream weak. To correct these mistakes use the VISAG.</p><p>Concentrates of acoustic energy are the same as with sound B.</p>"
