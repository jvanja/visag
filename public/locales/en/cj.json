  "letter": "<p>The lips are stretched and pressed against the teeth, and the shapedepends upon the following sound. Vertical distance between lips is 17mm.</p><p>The tip of the tongue is lightly support by the lower incisors, andthe middle of it stretches funlikely and lifts to the area of alveoli,so it makes narrow, flat resonator in the front of oral cavity. Thatresonator is located just behind the tip of the tongue. The edges of thetongue are supported by the both sides of the upper arch of the teethand together with them they make partition so the resonator, where theexpirium is run, is formed on the front part of the tongue.</p><p>Excluding the occlusion the tongue keeps its lifted position so thefriction is made there. The explosion follows it. So, as all theaffricates, the sound ] has two acoustic moments: explosion andfriction.</p><p>Soft palate is lifted.</p><p>Vocal chords do not vibrate - the sound ? is unvoiced.</p><p>Expiration is strong.</p><p>Acoustic value has three parts:</p><p>the first - plosive from 3000-3700Hz</p><p>the second - frictional from 4000-5000Hz</p><p>the third - final - from about 2500Hz</p><p>The sound ? has two characteristics concentrates of rustleenergy:</p><ol><li>from 2500-4000Hz</li><li>from 5000-6000Hz</li></ol>"
